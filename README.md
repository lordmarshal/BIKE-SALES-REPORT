# BIKE-SALES-REPORT
I completed KPMG AUSTRALIA VIRTUAL INTERNSHIP PROGRAM by forage yesternight addressing the business questions with a simple Power BI report.
I completed the KPMG Australia Virtual Internship Program by Forage last night, creating a Power BI report to address business questions. The project involved exploring a dataset from Sprocket Central, a company specializing in bike and accessory production.

Conducting a Data Quality Assessment, I communicated results to Sprocket Central, offering professional advice on data collection and storage. Analyzing three datasets—Customer Demography, Customer Address, and Transaction—I identified the customer segment for Sprocket Central's marketing team among the new 1000 customers and broader market.

Key Trends:

Mass Customers show the highest customer value among wealth segments.
Gen X (42-57 years) has the highest purchase compared to other age groups.
Sales are higher in Manufacturing and Financial Service categories.
Gender and car ownership show no significant effects.
Proposed Marketing Strategy:
Market Penetration: Focus on Solex and WeareA2B brands, considering price, promotion, and distribution adjustments for existing products in existing markets.

Target Segments in New 100 Customers:

Customers from New South Wales (NSW)
Gen X age bracket
Mass customers in the wealth segment
Manufacturing and Financial Services in Industry category.
I appreciate the opportunity from the Forage team and look forward to more experiences.
